As part of this task, we needed to implement an application that helps an individual in a team or a group of developers achieve their goals. This task seemed quite interesting to all of us, because it is a great opportunity to try to realize yourself in a team. We have implemented the possibility of registration, welcome page, user login, project management page, project management page. The application has the ability to change the language by clicking on select title in.  The layout is semantic. both React 18 and Typewritten text. The application has private routes, 404, error border. As well as the Welcome Page (route), Header and Footer, Login / Registration, Main Route, Board Route"
